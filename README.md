# Sample Twitter API Data Dashboard

## Installations

## Motivation

## File descriptions

## Summary of results
- working_notebook.ipynb
- wrangling_scripts/wrangling.py

- myapp.py, Procfile, nltk.txt, requirements.txt

## Authors
Data is provided through the Twitter API, and much of the boilerplate code for the index.html file is provided through the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The author of the Jupyter notebook and wrangle_data.py (which is most of the rest of the meaningful content in this repo) is me.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Twitter for providing the [API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets.html) to obtain tweet data for this analysis. Thanks to Udacity for including this project as part of their Data Scientist Nanodegree. I gained some experience with the Flask framework and deploying my first app on Heroku through this. Cool stuff.
